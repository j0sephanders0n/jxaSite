    <p id="artiststatement">I play a game with myself sitting in the passenger seat on the highway, 
        I'll look at everything, letting it soak into my eyes. I'll close my eyes to read the road signs later, 
        I'll push down hard on my eyes to let the fading world burst with color. I find rhythm in visual chaos, 
        like sitting down and playing a game of memory. I have a visceral urge to match, smash, 
        and stack these fleeting sensations, not with the goal of deconstructing this chaos 
        but rather to make it all sing loader. <br/> <br/> Culturally weâ€™ve looked at film as a confused medium:
         developed for science, used for magic, hijacked by literature, all for its unwavered power of deception. 
         We have matured in a society where we accept that film can be both a pure catalyst of truth, 
         as well as an ever expanding microscope into our fantastic minds. These contradicted realities 
         parallel one another's existence, peacefully aging alongside each other in one heterogeneous form. 
         Radically manipulating light is neither science, magic, or literature, it is our outward perception of the world. 
         Society needs to construct new methods of engagement; A mass reawakening to this phenomena that 
         catapults cultural perception. Still and moving images need to be its own medium and once and for all 
         sever its cultural proximity to its neighboring mediums. First and foremost we must go back in history 
         and re-explore these closed chapters in its fundamental development.
